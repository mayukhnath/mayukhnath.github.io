## Introduction
The STMicroelectronics STSPIN32G4 is an impressive chip with a high level of integration. It contains an ARM® Cortex®-M4 microcontroller, a high performance gate driver, and both a buck converter and linear regulator. Given the chip's potential to reduce packaging footprint as well as materials cost, it is a compelling choice for custom brushless DC (BLDC) or permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) driver solutions. This project is a development board that houses the STSPIN32G4 along with a high performance power stage and interface/communication circuitry. 

## Objectives
- Allow for evaluation of STSPIN32G4 capabilities in multiple configurations
- Provide relevant digital interfaces for control input and peripheral support (e.g. encoders)
- Integrate configurable power stage capable of driving a motor at up to 50V, 30A continuous
- Support trapezoidal, sinusoidal, or field oriented control (FOC) control schemes

## Design
- 6 layer PCB and low resistance MOSFETS allowing for up to 30A continous current
- CAN bus, USB, RS485, RS422, SPI, I2C, UART, and PWM communication interfaces
- Precision inline current sensing amplifiers, allowing for up to 100% duty cycle operation
- RGB LED with dedicated timers for feedback

## Outcomes
- Successfully fabricated, assembled, and powered the PCB
