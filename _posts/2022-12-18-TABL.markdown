## Introduction
The STMicroeletronics STSPIN32G4 is an impressive chip with a high level of integrateion. It contains an ARM® Cortex®-M4 microcontroller, a high performance gate driver, and both a buck converter and linear regulator. Given the potential to reduce packaging footprint as well as materials cost, it is a compelling choice for custom brushless DC (BLDC) or permanent magnet synchronous motor (PMSM) driver solutions. This project is a development board that houses the STSPIN32G4 along with a high peformance power stage and interface/communication circuitry. 

## Design
The goal of this device is to allow us to explore the capabillites of the STSPIN32G4 in various applications. Therefore, it is designed to support a broad range of configurations. It supports any control topology for 3 phase motors (excluding salient PMSM control). Furthermore, it has the ability to integrate current, velocity, or position based control loops. It provides the option of using either 6 individual or 6 parallel pairs of MOSFETS for applications up to 50 Volts and 30 Amps. Lastly, it supports a broad range of communication interfaces for control input as well as communication with peripherals such as encoders. 
### Features
- Capable of trapezoidal, sinusoidal, or field oriented control (FOC) control schemes
- CAN bus, USB, RS485, RS422, SPI, I2C, UART, and PWM communication interfaces
- Precision inline current sensing amplifiers, allowing for up to 100% duty cycle operation
- 6 layer PCB and low resistance MOSFETS allowing for up to 30A continous current
- RGB LED with dedicated timers for feedback
